# Booking Engine

## Goal

Answer:

Can this participant reserve this session right now, using which entitlement, and why?

## Pipeline

1. Resolve participant.
2. Resolve tenant/branch.
3. Validate booking window/priority.
4. Validate session state.
5. Validate participant eligibility.
6. Validate age/level/discipline rules.
7. Resolve eligible entitlements.
8. Validate branch/time restrictions.
9. Validate outstanding-balance policy if enabled.
10. Validate capacity and required resources.
11. Validate duplicate/conflicting booking rules.
12. Select entitlement source.
13. Acquire transactional capacity lock.
14. Place entitlement hold/consume according to policy.
15. Create booking.
16. Commit.
17. Emit BookingCreated.

## Explainability

Return stable error codes such as:
- BOOKING_NOT_OPEN
- MEMBERSHIP_REQUIRED
- ENTITLEMENT_EXHAUSTED
- LEVEL_REQUIRED
- AGE_NOT_ELIGIBLE
- CAPACITY_FULL
- RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE
- OUTSTANDING_BALANCE_BLOCK
- ALREADY_BOOKED

## Booking windows

Example:
- Premium member: 14 days
- Standard member: 10 days
- Package: 7 days
- Drop-in: 24 hours

Booking priority and pricing are separate concerns.

## Concurrency

Capacity must be protected by database transactions and locks.

Do not:
read capacity → check in PHP → insert
without transactional protection.

Use idempotency keys for booking creation.

## Cancellation

Policies may vary by:
- tenant
- branch
- activity
- offering
- membership/product

Example:
>= 6 hours: release entitlement
< 6 hours: forfeit entitlement

## Waitlist

Support:
- FIFO
- optional priority tiers
- auto-book or timed offer
- expiration and next-candidate promotion
